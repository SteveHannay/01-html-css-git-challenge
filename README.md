# Challenge 1 

Challenge 1 - project for module 01-html-css-git-challenge 

Developer - Steve Hannay
Completed - 5th December 2023


## Description

The aim of this project is to refactor existing HTML and CSS code (supplied by the Bootcamp team) to make the "Horiseon" webpage more accesible to users of all abilities.

Changes to the code have hopefully made is easier to read and maintain the code itself and also make the website more accessible and rebust. Alt attributes, semantic elements, comments, etc. have been used to achive this.

The following acceptance criteria was set for the code refactoring
- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

During the process of working on this project I have learned about the fundamentals of structured HTML and CSS coding (and the way in which they interact) when working on existing code. Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.


## Installation

Open the following webpage from any internet browser.

![link to Horiseon webpage](https://stevehannay.github.io/Challenge-1/)

No installation is necessary. 


## Usage

This is a very simple webpage to use, containing 3 options in the top navigation panel and scrollable content.

Here are screenshots of the webpage created for the project.

Unfortunately I had some issues taking a single screenshot (using PDF) which was small enough to upload to GitHub (I tried this several times and the upload failed). I will look into this going forward.


## Credits
